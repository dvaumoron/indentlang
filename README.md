# indentlang

A templating language mainly  to output balised language (html, xml, etc.). 

The file [main.il](exemple/main.il) should act like [main.html](https://github.com/dvaumoron/puzzleweb/blob/main/templates/main.html) for go templating.

The file [indentlang.go](indentlang.go) is an adapted copy of [engine.go](https://github.com/dvaumoron/ste/blob/master/engine.go) for demo and testing purpose.
